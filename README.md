## Calculator Project

This is a project I'm using to practice DOM manipulation with Javascript, as well as HTML and CSS styling.
The goal is to create a calculator, which works in the browser.
It should have functioning, clickable buttons, but should also work with keyboard input.
Desired learning outcomes are to become more proficient with Javascript in general and working with the DOM and also to gain confidence and ability with Webpage styling and layout.
By the completion of the project, I will have demonstrated my ability to create a working Javascript program connected to an interesting and clean visual interface, within the browser.

The original idea for this project comes from The Odin Project's [_**Curriculum**_](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator)


#### Update

After getting to a certain point in the project, I have equipped the calculator with the function to complete calculations.
However, it does not follow the correct order of operations when running multiple equations.
It also does not yet have a decimal point.
The UI is also rather limited.
And it does not have a working keyboard connectivity.

My goal with this project is literally to create a branch of the project at this point and then begin completely fresh on the master branch.
This would be so that a proper order of operations functionality can be implemented from the start.
As it is, the code feels messy and overwhelming and much of it will likely be redundant by the time I have correctly implemented an order of operations system.
I am thinking to use an array collection to do this.

I now intend to continue on with further projects, so that my back end abilities can grow and I will be able to complete other projects that I will need to soon complete.

When I return to this project, my first task will be to look at a real calculator app and take notes on its exact functionality and entire UX.
Once I have a good feel for exactly how I want this calculator to work, I will add it as a note below and then follow that note to complete the project.
