## Calculator Project

This is a project I'm using to practice DOM manipulation with Javascript, as well as HTML and CSS styling.
The goal is to create a calculator, which works in the browser.
It should have functioning, clickable buttons, but should also work with keyboard input.
Desired learning outcomes are to become more proficient with Javascript in general and working with the DOM and also to gain confidence and ability with Webpage styling and layout.
By the completion of the project, I will have demonstrated my ability to create a working Javascript program connected to an interesting and clean visual interface, within the browser.

The original idea for this project comes from The Odin Project's [_**Curriculum**_](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator)
